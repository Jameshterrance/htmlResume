    <h1>Little About myself:</h1>
    <p>
      I've been Working and Practicing coding for a year now Trying to make it
      into the IT for a while. I've been motivated and helped by my friend to
      always strive and acheieve more than other people
    </p>
    <p>
      I wish to work myself and become a FullStack Developer. I love building
      and creating new things specially with code since its literally creating
      something out of nothing and it helps practice my creative side of mind.
